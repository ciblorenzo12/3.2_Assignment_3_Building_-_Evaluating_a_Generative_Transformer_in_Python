I manually inspected generated summaries across baseline, improved prompting, and ablation experiments and identified several recurring failure modes.

Failure Type 1: Hallucinated facts
Example:
Reference:
Former Premier League footballer Sam Sodje has appeared in court alongside three brothers accused of charity fraud.
Prediction:
Former Reading defender denies fraudulent trading charges related to Sodje Sports Foundation, which raises funds for Nigerian sports; family members face trial in July.
Notes:
The model added additional details and expanded beyond the reference summary. While related to the article, it inserted unsupported information and over-explained the event.

Failure Type 2: Completely incorrect information (severe hallucination)
Example:
Reference:
Two teenagers have been charged in connection with an incident in west Belfast in which a car collided with two police vehicles.
Prediction:
Two teenagers have been arrested on suspicion of armed robbery. They face up to seven years in jail if convicted.
Notes:
The generated summary describes a completely different crime that does not appear in the article. This is a major hallucination and shows the model sometimes relies on prior knowledge patterns rather than the input text.

Failure Type 3: Entity confusion
Example:
Reference:
Barcelona football club chief Sandro Rosell has resigned following a Spanish court's decision to look into last year's signing of Brazil star Neymar.
Prediction:
FC Barcelona President Josep Maria Bartomeu has stepped down amid speculation about the transfer of Lionel Messi to Paris Saint-Germain.
Notes:
The model replaced the correct person (Sandro Rosell) with a different person and invented a different football transfer. This shows entity substitution errors common in generative transformers.

Failure Type 4: Missing key information
Example:
Reference:
The Duchess of Cambridge will feature on the cover of British Vogue to mark the magazine's centenary.
Prediction:
British royal Kate Middleton has agreed to pose for a photo shoot with British Vogue magazine.
Notes:
The summary omits the important reason (centenary celebration) and loses the main point of the article.

Failure Type 5: Numerical or detail corruption
Example:
Reference:
A pedestrian has been struck by a taxi in Dundee after it mounted the pavement.
Prediction:
A young man injured by a broken glass window during a university graduation party is being treated at hospital.
Notes:
The event type changed entirely. The model altered the cause of injury and location details.

Conclusion:
The improved structured prompt reduced verbosity and improved readability, but hallucinations and entity confusion still occur. The model is capable of producing fluent summaries but factual reliability is not guaranteed.
