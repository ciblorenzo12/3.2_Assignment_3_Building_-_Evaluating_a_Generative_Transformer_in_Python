Voges was forced to retire hurt on 86 after suffering the injury while batting during the County Championship draw with Somerset on 4 June.
Middlesex hope to have the Australian back for their T20 Blast game against Hampshire at Lord's on 3 August.
The 37-year-old has scored 230 runs in four first-class games this season at an average of 57.50.
"Losing Adam is naturally a blow as he contributes significantly to everything we do," director of cricket Angus Fraser said.
"His absence, however, does give opportunities to other players who are desperate to play in the first XI.
"In the past we have coped well without an overseas player and I expect us to do so now."
Defending county champions Middlesex are sixth in the Division One table, having drawn all four of their matches this season.
Voges retired from international cricket in February with a Test batting average of 61.87 from 31 innings, second only to Australian great Sir Donald Bradman's career average of 99.94 from 52 Tests.

Seven photographs taken in the Norfolk countryside by photographer Josh Olins will appear in the June edition.
In her first sitting for a magazine, the duchess is seen looking relaxed and wearing casual clothes.
The shoot was in collaboration with the National Portrait Gallery, where two images are being displayed in the Vogue 100: A Century of Style exhibition.
The duchess, who has a keen interest in photography, has been patron of the National Portrait Gallery since 2012.
Nicholas Cullinan, director of the National Portrait Gallery, said: "Josh has captured the duchess exactly as she is - full of life, with a great sense of humour, thoughtful and intelligent, and in fact, very beautiful."
He said the images also encapsulated what Vogue had done over the past 100 years - "to pair the best photographers with the great personalities of the day, in order to reflect broader shifts in culture and society".
Alexandra Shulman, editor-in-chief of British Vogue, said: "To be able to publish a photographic shoot with the Duchess of Cambridge has been one of my greatest ambitions for the magazine."
The collaboration for the June edition had resulted in "a true celebration of our centenary as well as a fitting tribute to a young woman whose interest in both photography and the countryside is well known", she said.
Other royal portraits to have featured in the fashion magazine include Diana, Princess of Wales - who graced the cover four times - and Princess Anne.

The signing of Neymar has been correct and his signing has caused despair and envy in some of our adversaries
Rosell, speaking at a news conference after a Barca board meeting, insisted he had "acted correctly".
Vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu now takes over from the 49-year-old Rosell, who came to power in 2010.
Rosell's future has been a real source of concern ever since a Spanish national court judge accepted a lawsuit this week from Barcelona club member Jordi Cases, who alleged that the amount paid for Neymar was more than the reported fee.
Rosell maintains the accusation is "unfair and reckless".
He added: "For some time, my family and myself have suffered threats and attacks in silence. These threats and attacks have made me wonder if being president means having to jeopardise my family.
"From the beginning, I have said the signing of Neymar has been correct and his signing has caused despair and envy in some of our adversaries."
Rosell said he was resigning to spare the club's board of directors from "unfair attacks" that could "negatively affect their management or the image of the club".
He added: "It has been an honour to serve the Barcelonistas. It's been a privilege to be the president of FC Barcelona."
Rosell was named Barca president in the summer of 2010 after winning a landslide vote to succeed Joan Laporta, earning 61.34% of a record turn-out of 57,088 voters.
He had also been vice-president under Laporta before resigning in 2005.

The think tank said the city's 1,536 schools needed to save £360m in the first year if the government's National Funding Formula (NFF) plan goes ahead.
The amount is the equivalent of 12,857 qualified teachers, on an average salary of £28,000.
The government said London was the highest funded part of the country.
It added that under the plans, which are under consultation, inner-city schools would be allocated 30% more money per pupil than the national average.
But London Councils, which represents the city's 32 boroughs and the City, said no school would gain enough funding from the NFF to compensate for increased cost pressures from inflation, higher pension contributions and national insurance.
Ministers said the new formula was needed to tackle uneven levels of funding across England, with the best funded areas getting more than £6,300 per pupil per year, while the worst-funded averaging £4,200.
It said the funding cut was on top of National Audit Office figures which showed England schools faced an eight per cent real-terms cut per pupil by 2019-20 because it  wider cost pressures.
In a statement, London Councils said: "At a time when UK schools are seen as underperforming by international standards, and when businesses based in London are facing massive uncertainty about recruiting skilled staff, there is an urgent need to invest in schools in London and across the rest of the country."
It added: "Without the right qualifications and skills, London's children will be unable to access jobs and contribute to the national economy. Over 60% of jobs in inner London require a degree and around 45% of jobs in the rest of the capital require a degree."

REFERENCE SUMMARY:
About 70% of London schools could face budget cuts under government plans to change how they are funded, according to London Councils.

GENERATED SUMMARY:
A think tank argues that London schools should receive extra funding under the government's National Funding Formula to compensate for rising costs, but London Councils counters that the formula could cause further cuts to funding in inner-city schools.

Ms Kendall told the BBC Labour risked sending a "resignation letter to the British people as a serious party of government" by electing Mr Corbyn.
Separately, Ms Cooper warned there was a "serious risk the party will split" if the left-winger becomes its leader.
It comes as Labour begins sending out the first ballot papers to voters.
The result of the contest will be announced at a special conference on 12 September.

Meanwhile voting in the election for the new Scottish Labour leader ended at midday.
Mr Corbyn is due to unveil a 10-point policy plan while in Glasgow later.
The popularity of the left-wing Islington North MP, who is promising "a new kind of politics", has sparked a row about the future direction of the Labour party.
Another leadership contender, Andy Burnham, told the BBC Mr Corbyn's policies "lack credibility".
"It's not possible to promise free university education, re-nationalising the utilities, without that coming at a great cost and if you can't explain how that is going to be paid for then I don't think we'll win back the trust of voters on the economy," he said.
BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said there had been "frustration" in rival camps who accused Mr Burnham of being reluctant to take on Mr Corbyn. This appeared to be his most direct attack yet, he added.
But in an interview with Jeremy Vine on BBC Radio 2, Mr Burnham declined to follow Ms Kendall and Ms Cooper and advise his supporters not to back Mr Corbyn with their second and third preferences.
He added: "People will say if they hear things like that, 'hang on, what do you believe?'"
In an interview with The Independent, Ms Kendall called for voters to mark Ms Cooper or Mr Burnham as second and third preferences, and avoid giving votes to Mr Corbyn.
"I have set out very clearly where I differ with all the candidates but our differences with Jeremy's kind of politics are far greater," said Ms Kendall.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme she said she "can't pretend to be agnostic" about a victory for Mr Corbyn, saying of the voting process: "It is an alternative vote system and I want to urge party members to use all of their different preferences.
"I will be using my second and third preferences and I would urge others to do the same because I don't want to see our party go back to the politics of the '80s, just being a party of protest."
The Leicester West MP also said she did not see the party splitting, as it did in the 1980s when Labour members formed the Social Democratic Party.
However, Ms Cooper told BBC 2's Newsnight: "I think there is a serious risk that the party will split, will polarise and I cannot bear to see that happen because there is too much at stake."
Asked in an interview with grassroots Labour website Labourlist whether voters should use their votes to try to prevent Mr Corbyn winning, she said: "I think people should use all of their preferences.
"And I think the focus has to be how do we make sure we can win that election, and that's the most important thing - and I don't think Jeremy can do that."
Mr Corbyn has warned against "personal abuse" in the campaign, saying he wants to focus on policy.
His policy programme includes a commitment to "growth not austerity", nationalising the railways and energy sector, and a plan for nuclear disarmament.
In an essay for the Fabian Society he also suggested Labour's new increased following should be more involved in the party and proposed a review of membership fees to make the party more "inclusive".
Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is expected to join the debate over the leadership contest with a speech on Sunday, called "power for a purpose - the future of the Labour Party".
Lance Price, former director of communications for Labour, told the BBC the contest had been an "unedifying mess" and had "done nothing to reengage the labour party with those millions of people who deserted it".
The Guardian newspaper has endorsed Ms Cooper for the leadership while the Daily Mirror has given its backing to Mr Burnham, although the paper urged him to "find a role" in his team for Mr Corbyn, who it says has "lit up the election campaign".

Labour leadership hopefuls Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have said their supporters should back anyone other than Jeremy Corbyn in the contest.

The Association of School and College Leaders says England's schools have had to make more than £1bn savings this year, rising to £3bn by 2020.
The government says school funding is at a record £40bn, with rises ahead.
Education Secretary Justine Greening will hear heads' cash grievances at Friday's ASCL conference in Birmingham.
She is due to address the union, which has published a survey of its members on the issue.
It suggests schools are finding it difficult to make savings without cutting provision and that things are predicted to get worse over the next two years.
Cost pressures are rising as greater pay, pension and national insurance costs are having to be covered from school budgets.
ASCL complains a new funding formula for schools has reduced the basic level of school funding going forwards by too much.
The meeting comes two days after requests for more money to spend on daily school costs were ignored by the chancellor in the Budget.
Philip Hammond however did pledge £500m for school buildings, mainly new free schools - some of which could be grammar schools.
One respondent said his school was moving to a "bare bones education", in which "the components that make education special and enjoyable are being eroded away".
Some 95% of the 1,054 heads, deputies and senior teachers responding to the survey said they had cut back on support services - including equipment and materials, as well as mental health and special needs support.
More than eight out of 10 said class sizes had increased - a claim strongly refuted by the Department for Education.
And more than two-thirds said they had cut back on activities like clubs and trips.
Just under three-quarters of respondents with GCSE-level classes said they had cut courses and just over three-quarters of heads with A-level students said they had also reduced subjects.
Foreign modern languages, music, arts and drama were among subjects removed at A-level.
Another said: "Through no fault of their own, students will have restricted subject choices, in larger class sizes with less pastoral support, whilst still being expected to perform at the highest of standards - nonsense!"
One head said his school may have to axe its sixth form provision for next year and another said his school was starting to "creak" with all staff working to full capacity.
Interim general secretary, Malcolm Trobe, said: "School leaders will do their utmost to protect provision, as they always do, but they cannot provide everything that is asked of them without the resources they need.
"Unless the government invests more in the education system, there will be a significant impact on the lives and life chances of young people."
A spokesman for the DfE said: "As this week's Budget demonstrates, the government is determined to ensure every child has access to a good school place and is given the opportunity to fulfil their potential.
"The government has protected the core schools budget in real terms since 2010, with school funding at its highest level on record at more than £40bn in 2016-17 - and that is set to rise, as pupil numbers rise over the next two years, to £42bn by 2019-20."

Former Norwich City midfielder Keith Briggs took over from Roy Soule, who stepped down in June, but resigned after just 23 days for a job with Sheffield United's academy.
Andy Fearn was put in charge in July and appointed former Manchester City striker Shaun Goater as his assistant.
But Fearn and Goater lasted just nine league and cup games before resigning after a 7-1 home defeat to Prescot Cables.

The cafe has appealed for public support, saying it was no prank but a case of intimidation by neo-Nazis.
The attackers wore strings of sausages round their necks and threw chunks of meat onto customers' plates, the BBC's Rayhan Demytrie reports from Tbilisi.
They are known as the Bergmann group, and a social media page shows their attacks on people of Arab or African origin, our correspondent reports. One photograph shows members making the Nazi salute.
The Kiwi cafe is in a traditional part of old Tbilisi, and is popular among young people sporting unconventional hairstyles, tattoos and body piercings.
Most Georgians are Orthodox Christians and many see unorthodox lifestyles as a corrupting influence from the West.
The cafe said it had drawn some local hostility because of "the way we look, music that we listen to, ideas we support, and the fact that we don't eat meat" and backing of causes such as rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.
"During these hard times you can support us just by visiting our cafe, we will be very grateful if you come to show everyone that here are a lot of us who care about the issue!" the Kiwi cafe said in a statement on Facebook.
It later told the BBC it had received strong messages of solidarity - from Georgia and abroad - but that people had also left angry comments trying "to defend those fascists".
It said it was also appealing for financial contributions to install security cameras in case of repeat incidents.
The incident comes amid growing concerns about the rise of far-right nationalism in Georgia.
Last week, hundreds of nationalists marched through central Tbilisi - waving Georgian flags and anti-communist banners, reports said - to mark independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
Homophobia is also commonplace in Georgia, correspondents say. The country made world headlines in 2013 when a small group of LGBT activists were attacked by a large mob led by an orthodox priest.
The cafe statement blames Sunday's incident on the group of men who came into the premises, talking loudly, throwing meat and smoking, and then "yelling, laughing, and talking to us sarcastically".
These people "were neo-Nazis... who support fascist ideas", the cafe said.
Some minor injuries were sustained.
The police arrived only after the attackers had left, but the cafe said even some of those officers behaved aggressively, "yelled with anger, said that we are guilty of what had happened".

The New Zealander made only one unenforced switch, bringing in Rhys Webb for Gareth Davies at scrum-half.
Sam Warburton, Alun Wyn Jones and Alex Cuthbert miss out with injuries.
"We wanted to give the players a chance to sort of put behind us a disappointing first half from last week," said Gatland.
Flanker Justin Tipuric, second row Luke Charteris and Hallam Amos are drafted in to the team in place of the injured players.
Dan Lydiate will captain the side in the absence of Warburton and regular stand-in Jones.
Gatland said he had shown faith in players who had performed well in earlier matches, a fact he acknowledged was hard on hooker Ken Owens who makes his fourth appearance on the bench in this Six Nations championship.
"He's unlucky, really unlucky," he added.
"We felt that [hooker] Scott Baldwin has gone pretty well throughout the campaign.
"Ken has been brilliant for us coming off the bench and I know that's a tag he doesn't want to keep, but he is unlucky not to get a start."
Scarlets hooker Owens had made 38 appearances for Wales, but started in only eight of those games.
Wales go into the match against Italy knowing a win will secure second place in the championship for the first time since it was expended to include six countries.
Lydiate will lead Wales for the first time in a Test match, having previously led them in a midweek match against EP Kings on the summer tour of South Africa in 2014.
He said it was a "personal honour for me and my family" and added his captaincy style was unsophisticated.
"I wouldn't ask someone to do something that I wouldn't do myself, so I'll throw myself in front of a bus so that's what I expect everyone else to do," he said.
"There are plenty of leaders and a wealth of experience in the team."

Then playing for Walsall, the 24-year-old won his first senior cap for Wales in their defeat by Ukraine in March, giving him the chance to rub shoulders with the duo.
Injury dashed his hopes of joining them at Euro 2016, however.
"They constantly want to improve and get better so that's something every footballer should apply to their game," Bradshaw told BBC Radio Wales.

Wales have been buoyed by the success of Arsenal midfielder Ramsey and Real Madrid forward Bale in 2016 as they reached the semi-finals of the European Championships, their first international tournament for 58 years.
Bradshaw, who has scored three goals in 19 appearances for the Tykes this season, puts the success of the pair down to two factors.
"You watch them train and you watch them play and you try to pick their brains about how they managed to get to that level," he said.
"A lot of it is natural ability and natural talent, but the thing that strikes me is their hunger; their hunger to want to improve even though Gareth's playing for Real Madrid and he's a massive part of his country's team."
Bradshaw says he was "gutted" to miss out on Wales' memorable Euro 2016 campaign after a calf injury ruled him out of contention.
The former Aberystwyth Town player has since concentrated on boosting his future Wales hopes by performing well for his new club Barnsley.
"It was incredibly frustrating, with hindsight as well, at how well the lads did," he said.
"I was incredibly proud of the boys and how impressive they were at the Euros. I was gutted, but that's football. Unfortunately that was part and parcel of the game.
"But I picked my head up and managed to get a move to the Championship and I'm just trying to improve. It hurt for a while. It took for the majority of that summer for me to get over it.
"I was watching all the games and cheering the lads on from afar, but it was invaluable experience for me to go away to Portugal although I didn't manage to train that much because of the injury, it's all experience that I've enjoyed and hopefully I can put it into good use in the future and hopefully one day I'll get an opportunity again."

REFERENCE SUMMARY:
Barnsley striker Tom Bradshaw says every footballer can learn from the examples set by Wales stars Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey.

GENERATED SUMMARY:
Tom Bradshaw, a 24-year-old Welsh professional footballer, missed out on playing in the 2016 Euro Cup due to an injury and focused on improving his performance for Barnsley instead. He attributes their success to the players' dedication and desire to grow professionally.
