# 3.2_Assignment_3_Building_-_Evaluating_a_Generative_Transformer_in_Python
This project builds and evaluates a generative transformer model in Python using Hugging Face and PyTorch. It compares prompting and lightweight fine-tuning using LoRA, measures quality and efficiency with standard metrics, and analyzes limitations, bias, and safety risks through reproducible experiments.
